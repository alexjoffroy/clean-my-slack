# clean-my-slack
CLI tool to easily batch delete messages from your Slack channels. 

## Installation

```
yarn add -g clean-my-slack 
```
or:
```
npm i -g clean-my-slack
```

## Configuration

### Create a token for your workspace to use Slack API

- Go to https://api.slack.com/apps 
- Create a new app on the desired workspace (you must be logged in to this workspace)
- In your app settings, go to "OAuth & Permissions"
- In the "Scopes" tab, add the `channel:read`, `group:read`, `chat:write:users` scopes and apply changes
- On the top, click on "Install App to workspace", then "Authorize" the app when prompting
- Finally, copy your previously generated token ðŸ™‚

### Register the workspace in the CLI

Add your workspace to your CLI by running:
```
cmsk workspace:add -n <workspace> -t <token>
```

> The name provided with -n option could be different of the real Slack workspace name.
> It's only for identification purpose at CLI side

## Usage

When one of your Slack channel becomes dirty, just run the following:
```
cmsk clean -n <workspace> -c <channel>
```

This will delete all messages from the channel, starting from the last.

> Due to Slack API's limitation, the CLI will delete 1 message per second, not more. 
> If your Slack channel is very dirty, it can take a while before beeing clean again ðŸ˜‰
